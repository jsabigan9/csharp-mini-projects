# Grade Checker

## Exercise:
This project is designed to practice using the ternary operator in C# to determine a student's grade based on their exam score.

## Overview:
The Grade Checker program is a simple console application that prompts the user to enter their exam score and uses the ternary operator to determine their corresponding grade. The program provides an error message for invalid inputs.

## Project Description:
The program starts by prompting the user to enter their exam score. It includes optional error handling to ensure a valid numeric score is provided. The ternary operator is then used to determine the grade based on specific score ranges. The program outputs the calculated grade.

The grading scale used is as follows:
- A: 90 or above
- B: 80 - 89
- C: 70 - 79
- D: 60 - 69
- F: Below 60

## How to Use:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your exam score when prompted.
3. The program will determine your grade using the ternary operator and display the result.

Feel free to use the Grade Checker to practice working with the ternary operator in C# and quickly determine your grade based on exam scores.
