# Age Groups

## Overview

This C# console application allows users to input their name and age, and it determines their age group: Child, Teenager, Adult, or Senior.

## Project Description

The project prompts the user to enter their name and age and provides a welcome message based on their age group.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter your name when prompted.

## Age Group Criteria

- If age is less than 12, the user is considered a Child.
- If age is between 13 and 19 (inclusive), the user is considered a Teenager.
- If age is between 20 and 64 (inclusive), the user is considered an Adult.
- If age is 65 or older, the user is considered a Senior.
