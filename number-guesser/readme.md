This project is designed to help beginners practice using the `while` loop and the C# `Random` class.

## Overview:
The Number Guessing Game is a simple console application where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 7. The game provides hints and allows the player three attempts to make a correct guess.

## Project Description:
The program initializes a random number using the `Random` class and prompts the user to guess the number.

2. Follow the instructions to guess the randomly generated number.
3. You have three attempts to guess the correct number.
4. After each game, the program will ask if you want to play again. Type 'Y' or 'N' to continue or exit.

The game is a simple yet effective exercise for practicing the usage of `while` loops and the `Random` class in C#.
