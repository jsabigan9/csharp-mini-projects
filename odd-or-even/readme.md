# Odd or Even Checker

## Exercise:
This project focuses on practicing the ternary operator in C#.

## Overview:
The Odd or Even Checker project is a simple console application that prompts the user to enter a whole number. It then checks whether the entered number is odd or even using the ternary operator. The user has the option to check another number if desired.

## Project Description:
The program continuously prompts the user to enter a whole number. It validates the input to ensure it is a valid whole number. If the input is not a whole number, the program provides appropriate error messages. If the input is a valid whole number, the program uses the ternary operator to determine whether it is odd or even and displays the result.

The user can choose to check another number by entering 'y' or exit the program by entering 'n'.

## How to Use:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter a whole number when prompted.
3. The program will inform you whether the entered number is odd or even.
4. Choose to check another number or exit the program.

Feel free to use the Odd or Even Checker to practice working with the ternary operator in C# and quickly determine the parity of numbers.
