# Calculator

## Exercise:
This project is designed to help beginners practice using the `switch` statement in C#.

## Overview:
The Calculator project is a simple console application that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. It allows the user to input two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /), and then it performs the corresponding calculation using a `switch` statement.

## Project Description:
The program prompts the user to enter the first number, choose an operator, and enter the second number. It then uses a `switch` statement to determine the operation to perform and displays the result. Additionally, the program handles division by zero by checking if the divisor is zero before performing the division.

## How to Use:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter an operator (+, -, *, /) when prompted.
4. Enter the second number when prompted.
5. The program will display the result of the calculation.
