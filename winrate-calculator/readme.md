# Winrate Calculator

## Exercise:
This project involves creating a basic winrate calculator in C#.

## Overview:
The Winrate Calculator program allows users to input the total number of games played and the number of wins for a player. It then calculates and displays the win rate and related statistics.

## Project Description:
The program is structured with three classes: `DisplayMenu`, `PlayerStats`, and the main `Program` class. The `DisplayMenu` class provides an introduction to the program, the `PlayerStats` class manages player statistics and win rate calculations, and the `Program` class handles user input and interaction.

### Features:
- Input the total number of games played.
- Input the number of wins.
- Input validation.
- Calculate and display the win rate (percentage).
- Display total games played, wins, and win rate statistics.

### How to Use:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the total number of games played when prompted.
3. Enter the number of wins when prompted.
4. The program will calculate and display the win rate and statistics.

Feel free to use the Winrate Calculator to practice working with classes specially on Encapsulation and basic calculations in C# and analyze player win rates.
