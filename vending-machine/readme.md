# Vending Machine

## Exercise:
This project is designed to practice the `switch` statement in C#.

## Overview:
The Vending Machine project is a simple console application simulating a vending machine. It exercises the use of a `switch` statement to handle different menu options, allowing users to select an item and make a purchase. The program checks if the inserted money is sufficient for the selected item and provides change accordingly.

## Project Description:
The program presents a menu of items with their corresponding prices:
1. Chips             $1.50
2. Chocolate Bar     $2.00
3. Soda              $1.25
4. Water             $1.00

The user is prompted to enter their choice, and the program uses a `switch` statement to handle the selected option. It then asks the user to insert money and calculates the change based on the selected item's price.

## How to Use:
1. Run the program.
2. Choose an item from the menu by entering the corresponding number.
3. Follow the prompts to insert money.
4. The program will inform you whether the purchase was successful and provide change if applicable.

Please note that the program validates whether the inserted money is sufficient for the chosen item and handles cases where the user has not inserted enough money.

Feel free to use the Vending Machine simulator to practice working with `switch` statements in C# and simulate purchasing items from a vending machine.
