# Factorial Calculator

## Exercise:
This project is designed to practice using the `for` loop in C# to calculate the factorial of a given number.

## Overview:
The Factorial Calculator program is a console application that allows users to input a whole number and calculates its factorial using a `for` loop. The program provides an option to calculate the factorial repeatedly.

## Project Description:
The program continuously prompts the user to enter a whole number. It calculates the factorial of the entered number using a `for` loop, where the factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number. The result is then displayed.

The user can choose to calculate the factorial of another number by pressing any key, and the program will clear the console for a new calculation.

## How to Use:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter a whole number when prompted.
3. The program will calculate and display the factorial of the entered number.
4. Press any key to calculate the factorial of another number.
5. The program will continue to prompt for input and calculate factorials indefinitely.

Feel free to use the Factorial Calculator to practice working with `for` loops in C# and calculate factorials for different numbers.
